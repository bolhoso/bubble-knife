BubbleKnife

A copy o Jake Wharton's Butter Knife (http://novoda.com/blog) framework. 
Basically I've copied the initial commit (https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/commit/8b971011893613245ab662450ee6555c30333c7f) as a way of understanding how the library works

This project won't be maintained, but you may find it useful as:
 - understand how ButterKnife works in a more granular way (I made more commits to mimetize the initial commit of the library)
 - as an example of how to create annotation processing libraries
 - as a way of running annotation processing libs using gradle/Android Studio

Have fund ;)
